# Bio-Inspired Optimization Algorithms to Solve The Traveling Salesman Problem 
This is a repository for my Intro to Artificial Intelligence (undergraduate class) final project, where I adapted bio-inspired algorithms from SwarmPackagePy to solve TSP. 
The PDF of my paper can be found in this repository.
